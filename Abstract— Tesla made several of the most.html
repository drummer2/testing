Abstract— Tesla made several of the most signifcant discover￾
ies in electric power systems and wireless signal transmission.
These contributions were crucial in enabling economic and
technological progress leading to our modern world. In his
long creative life, he impacted many other areas in engineering,
sciences, medicine, and art. This paper discusses examples of
Tesla’s work as it infuenced others in diverse areas over a long
period of time, continuing to the present day.
Tesla could do in his own mind, without the help of outside
machines, is ust what is now recommended by consultants
investigating the successful use of interactive computer-aidded
design and other three dimensional graphics computing sys￾
tems: The speed and ower of 3D computing has all but
eliminated the requirements to roduce hysical rototypes
and models.
